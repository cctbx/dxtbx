Reduce number of redundant file operations in dxtbx

This includes a change in the DataBlock() construction semantics: sequences from
identical detectors are merged into a single DataBlock() object regardless of
their position in the call order. Since DataBlock() is deprecated and any
reliance on order would have to be handled explicitly downstream anyway this
should not have any impact on users or developers.
