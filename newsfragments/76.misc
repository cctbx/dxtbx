Remove unnecessary `__init__` and `_start` methods from Format classes:

- There is no need for every subclass to redefine the `__init__` method and
call its parent's `__init__` method. As well as a lot of unnecessary code
duplication, this also led to the subclass `self.understand()` method
being called once for every class in the format class hierarchy.
- There is no need for every subclass to redefine the `_start()` method and
call its parent's `_start()` method.
- Use `super()` where applicable.
