Improve integration performance

If no external gain map is set then the gain map is populated from the detector
panel gain value. This is not very efficient, especially if the gain is 1.0 and
the pedestal is 0.0.

This pull request implements a change to get_gain and get_pedestal which means
that if the detector panel gain is 1.0 then an empty array is returned from
get_gain and is pedestal is 0.0 an empty array is returned from get_pedestal.
